Rem /* The ExitWindowsEx function either logs off the current user, shuts down the system, or shuts

Rem  * @uFlags      : [in] Specifies the type of shutdown.
Rem  * @dwReason    : Windows XP: [in] Specifies the reason for initiating the shutdown.
Rem  *                Windows 2000 and earlier, Windows 95/98/Me: This parameter is ignored.
Rem  * Return Values: If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.
Rem  *                If the function fails, the return value is zero.
Rem  * Remarks      :
Rem  * The ExitWindowsEx function returns as soon as it has initiated the shutdown. The shutdown or logoff
Rem  * then proceeds asynchronously.
Rem  * To set a shutdown priority for an application relative to other applications in the system,
Rem  * use the SetProcessShutdownParameters function.
Rem  * During a shutdown or log-off operation, applications that are shut down are allowed a specific
Rem  * amount of time to respond to the shutdown request. If the time expires, the system displays a
Rem  * dialog box that allows the user to forcibly shut down the application, to retry the shutdown,
Rem  * or to cancel the shutdown request. If the EWX_FORCE value is specified, the system always forces
Rem  * applications to close and does not display the dialog box.
Rem  * Windows 2000/XP: If the EWX_FORCEIFHUNG value is specified, the system forces hung applications
Rem  * to close and does not display the dialog box.
Rem  * Windows 95/98/Me: Because of the design of the shell, calling ExitWindowsEx with EWX_FORCE fails
Rem  * to completely log off the user (the system terminates the applications and displays the Enter
Rem  * Windows Password dialog box, however, the user's desktop remains.) To log off the user forcibly
Rem  * , terminate the Explorer process before calling ExitWindowsEx with EWX_LOGOFF and EWX_FORCE.
Rem  * Console processes receive a separate notification message, CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT or CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT
Rem  * , as the situation warrants. A console process routes these messages to its HandlerRoutine function.
Rem  * ExitWindowsEx sends these notification messages asynchronously; thus, an application cannot
Rem  * assume that the console notification messages have been handled when a call to ExitWindowsEx
Rem  * returns.
Rem  * Windows NT/2000/XP: To shut down or restart the system, the calling process must use the
Rem  * AdjustTokenPrivileges function to enable the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege.
Rem  * Windows 95/98/Me: ExitWindowEx does not work from a console application.

Rem For some API functions, such as SendMessage or PostMessage, you may need to package two short
Rem Integer values into a Long variable to pass them as a single parameter.
Rem The trick to packing values is bit shifting. Because Visual Basic does not provide bit shift
Rem operators to use, you need to do things the old fashioned way; through multiplication. To make
Rem an Integer the high word for a Long value, you need to multiply it by &H10000. This has the effect
Rem of shifting the bit values 16-bits (2-bytes) to the left, making room for the low word value you
Rem want to add.
Rem Before you can add the low word value, however, you need to make an adjustment. Remember that Visual
Rem Basic Integer types are signed values, but the low word value needs to be unsigned if you plan to add
Rem it to your high word value. To make sure Visual Basic treats the low word as an unsigned integer, you
Rem need to perform a bitwise "And" on the value using &HFFFF& as a mask. In effect, this saves the value
Rem as a Long integer with the high (signed) bit cleared but keeps the original Integer's bit value preserved.
